## Model Architecture

The model is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The key components of the model include:

- Convolutional layers
- MaxPooling layers
- Fully connected (Dense) layers
- Dropout layers for regularization

The model is designed to take input images of size 228*228*3.
